This is a fork of the [Blackfont repository](https://github.com/blackro-se/blackfont),
which is a fork of the [Hasklig repository](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig),  which
in turn is a fork of the [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).

I don't like some of the existing ligatures, e.g. `≤`, `≥`, which are more like unicodes
than ligatures. I also want to add some of the ligatures specifically for Julia programming
language, e.g. `<:`.

The available ligatures, compared with their Source Code Pro counterparts, are:

See [HowToAddALigature.md](HowToAddALigature.md) for instructions on how to add more.
